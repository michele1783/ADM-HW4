# ADM-HW4
In this project we have played with a dataset gathering songs from the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference. We have focused on the track information, features (extracted with librosa library from Python) and audio variables provided by Echonest (now Spotify).

`utils_functions`: is a file.py we have written all our functions implemented from scratch to achieve all the goals of **Homework 4 - Hard coding**.

`homeworkpca`: is a jupyter notebook where we show all requested tables, plots and comments.
